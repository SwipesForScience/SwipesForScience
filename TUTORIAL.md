# Tutorial on eviction.swipesforscience.org

## Introduction

### Why do we need your help

evictions.swipesforscience is a web-app, designed to speed up creating
training data for certain machine learning problems by the UW [evictions
research group](https://evictions.study).  The main focus of the
current version of the app is to code _addresses of premises_ in
eviction documents.  We have developed a machine learning algorithm
that extracts the relevant addresses from court records.  However,
there are a number of problems:

* Some documents do not contain addresses, or do not contain these in
  places/form that the algorithm can understand.
* We are currently unable to read handwritten addresses, and several
  forms are hand-filled.
* As the documents are essentially photocopies, low image quality may
  render address unrecognizeable.  OCR software sometimes also lumps
  unrelated text inside of addresses.
* Sometimes the algorithm picks a wrong address, for instance the
  attorney's address instead of that of the premises.

In order to address these problems, we need a certain amount of
"ground truth", a few thousand addresses that are known to be
correct.  The only way to get this information is manually, by
carefully considering each lawsuit documents and writing down the
address therein.


### What is this app about

But wading through a lot of paperwork, and noting not just the address
but also the cryptic case number is a slow and laborious process.  In
order to speed it up as much as possible we have developed this app.
The app helps you work faster and be more precise:

* it pre-loads the new document each time you submit the previous
  one.  It also displays the one that is most likely to contain the
  address (the summons).
* it also offers you pre-filled form next to the page image where you
  can mark your corrections, or write a completely new address if the
  automatically extracted one is wrong (or missing altoghether).
* it automatically records all the necessary meta-information,
  including county, year, and case number.  So there is no need to
  record that hard-to-memorize number!


### How to use the app

(some commented screenshots.  may use the Antonius and Kleopatra
example).


#### Address components

We have split address into a number standardized components and would
like to learn all components separately.  For instance, the address
_1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500_ contains the
following parts: _1600_ is **house number**, _Pennsylvania_ is
**street name**, _Avenue_ is **street type**, _NW_ is **Post
Direction**, _Washington_ is **city**, _DC_ is **state** and _20500_
is **zip**.





## To start the app on your local machine.

1. git clone https://github.com/wjbarng/SwipesForScience.git
2. Navigate to the folder which you cloned the repository and run command "npm install"
3. When done installing npm, run command "npm run dev"
4. The application should be running on "localhost:8080"

## Quickstart

1. Go to https://evictions.swipesforscience.org/#/
2. Create an account
<br />2-1. You will need an email account, username, and password.
<br />2-2. You must sign up the consent form to proceed.
3. Receive private key
<br />3-1. After we review your application, we wil send you a key that enables you to access the play section of the app. Because the section may contain confidential information, please do not distribute the key to anyone.
<br />3-2. Once you input the key, you will be able to play.
