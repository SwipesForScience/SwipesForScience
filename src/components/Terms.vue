    <h6>RESEARCHER'S STATEMENT:</h6>
    <p>
      We are asking you to be in a research study. The purpose of this consent
      form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide
      whether to be in the study or not. Please read the form carefully. You may
      ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to
      do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and
      anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. Please
      email <a href="#">richford@uw.edu</a> if you have any questions. When we
      have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the
      study or not. This process is called "informed consent."
    </p>
    <h6>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h6>
    <p>
      Image annotation is needed to extract data from images. The purpose of
      this study is to train better computer algorithms to annotate images, and
      also correct any errors the computer makes. We aim to 1) collect image
      annotation data from you, and 2) combine annotations from many users into
      the most accurate annotation. This information will be used to train new
      computer algorithms.
    </p>
    <h6>STUDY PROCEDURES</h6>

    <p>
      You will be asked to log in. You may be given the option to use an
      existing social media login (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.), and
      you may be asked to create an anonymous username to be displayed to the
      public. You may also choose to include your social media avatar to display
      alongside your anonymous username in the public leaderboard.
      Alternatively, you may also have the option to use an anonymous login. You
      may provide your email when you sign up for an account if you wish to be
      contacted about future work related to this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be given instructions on how to annotate images for a particular
      task. Try your best to annotate the images as quickly and accurately as
      you can. You may complete however many tasks you wish. Each task can take
      anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. You may stop annotating at any
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may use any device with a web browser (computer, tablet, or phone). We
      will record all settings you use on the application, your annotations,
      your screen resolution, and your anonymous username. This data will be
      made publicly available to researchers.
    </p>
    <h6>RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h6>
    <p>
      Some people feel that providing information for research or having the
      research session recorded is an invasion of privacy. If you wish to remain
      anonymous, we recommend creating an anonymous nickname that does not
      include any identifiers relating to you.
    </p>
    <h6>BENEFITS OF THE STUDY</h6>
    <p>
      This study will help us to extract accurate data from images. This
      information will be used for scientific research.
    </p>

    <h6>CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION</h6>
    <p>
      Your social media login information (such as username and email address),
      if provided, will remain confidential and will not be shared outside the
      study team. Government or university staff sometimes review studies such
      as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a
      review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The
      reviewers will protect your privacy. The study records will not be used to
      put you at legal risk of harm.
    </p>
    <h6>RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY</h6>
    <p>
      If you think you have been harmed from being in this research, contact
      Adam Richie-Halford at <a href="#">richford@uw.edu</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      * Please note that we cannot ensure the confidentiality of information
      sent via e-mail.

    <h6>SUBJECTâ€™S STATEMENT</h6>

      consenting on my own behalf, that I am age 18 or older, and I volunteer to

      on the first page of this consent form. If I have questions about my
